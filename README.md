## 📖 Introduction

QuantMesh is a high-performance, low-latency cryptocurrency market maker system focusing on long grid trading strategies for perpetual contract markets. Developed in Go and driven by WebSocket real-time data streams, it aims to provide stable liquidity support for major exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and Gate.io.

After several iterations, we have used this system to trade over $100 million in virtual currency. For example, trading Binance ETHUSDC with zero fees, a price interval of $1, and $300 per order, the daily trading volume can exceed $3 million, and over $50 million per month. As long as the market is oscillating or trending upward, it will continue to generate profits. If the market falls unilaterally, $30,000 in margin can guarantee no liquidation for a drop of 1000 points. Through continuous trading to lower costs, a 50% recovery is enough to break even, and returning to the original opening price can yield substantial profits. If there is a unilateral rapid decline, the active risk control system will automatically identify and immediately stop trading, only allowing continued orders when the market recovers, without worrying about liquidation from price spikes.

Example: Starting trading ETH at 3000 points, the price drops to 2700 points, losing approximately $3,000. When the price recovers to above 2850 points, it breaks even. Returning to 3000 points, profits range from $1,000 to $3,000.

## Best Practices

1. **For Exchange VIP Status**: This system is a volume generation tool. If price fluctuations are not large, $3,000 in margin can generate $10 million in trading volume in 2-3 days.

2. **Best Practice for Profit**: Enter the market after a round of decline. First buy a position, then start the software. It will automatically sell grid by grid upward. When your position is sold out, stop the system. If you're unsure whether the current market is a low point, you can start without a base position. If it falls further, add a position at the low point and restart to continue selling. This maximizes profits. Repeat this cycle to continuously profit. Don't worry about declines - the program continuously lowers costs. As long as it recovers by half, you break even.
