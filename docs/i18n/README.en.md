## 📖 Introduction

QuantMesh is a high-performance, low-latency cryptocurrency market maker system focusing on long grid trading strategies for perpetual contract markets. Developed in Go and driven by WebSocket real-time data streams, it aims to provide stable liquidity support for major exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and Gate.io.

After several iterations, we have used this system to trade over $100 million in virtual currency. For example, trading Binance ETHUSDC with zero fees, a price interval of $1, and $300 per order, the daily trading volume can exceed $3 million, and over $50 million per month. As long as the market is oscillating or trending upward, it will continue to generate profits. If the market falls unilaterally, $30,000 in margin can guarantee no liquidation for a drop of 1000 points. Through continuous trading to lower costs, a 50% recovery is enough to break even, and returning to the original opening price can yield substantial profits. If there is a unilateral rapid decline, the active risk control system will automatically identify and immediately stop trading, only allowing continued orders when the market recovers, without worrying about liquidation from price spikes.

Example: Starting trading ETH at 3000 points, the price drops to 2700 points, losing approximately $3,000. When the price recovers to above 2850 points, it breaks even. Returning to 3000 points, profits range from $1,000 to $3,000.

## Best Practices

1. **For Exchange VIP Status**: This system is a volume generation tool. If price fluctuations are not large, $3,000 in margin can generate $10 million in trading volume in 2-3 days.

2. **Best Practice for Profit**: Enter the market after a round of decline. First buy a position, then start the software. It will automatically sell grid by grid upward. When your position is sold out, stop the system. If you're unsure whether the current market is a low point, you can start without a base position. If it falls further, add a position at the low point and restart to continue selling. This maximizes profits. Repeat this cycle to continuously profit. Don't worry about declines - the program continuously lowers costs. As long as it recovers by half, you break even.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Network environment capable of accessing exchange APIs

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghostsworm/quantmesh.git
   cd quantmesh
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. Edit `config.yaml` and fill in your API Key and strategy parameters:

   ```yaml
   app:
     current_exchange: "binance"  # Select exchange

   exchanges:
     binance:
       api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
       secret_key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
       fee_rate: 0.0002

   trading:
     symbol: "ETHUSDT"       # Trading pair
     price_interval: 2       # Grid spacing (price)
     order_quantity: 30     # Amount per grid (USDT)
     buy_window_size: 10    # Number of buy orders
     sell_window_size: 10   # Number of sell orders
   ```

### Usage

#### Production Mode

Run the compiled binary:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or build and run:

```bash
go build -o quantmesh
./quantmesh
```

The backend will serve the frontend static files on port 28888 (default).

#### Development Mode

For frontend development with hot reload and source code debugging:

**Option 1: Use the development script (Recommended)**

```bash
./dev.sh
```

This script will:
- Start the Go backend server on port 28888
- Start the Vite dev server on port 15173
- Enable hot reload for frontend code changes
- Provide source maps for debugging (no minified code)

Then access the application at: **http://localhost:15173**

**Option 2: Manual startup**

Terminal 1 - Start Go backend:
```bash
go run main.go
```

Terminal 2 - Start Vite dev server:
```bash
cd webui
pnpm dev
```

Then access the application at: **http://localhost:15173**

**Development Mode Benefits:**
- ✅ Hot reload - Frontend code changes are instantly reflected
- ✅ Source maps - Debug with original TypeScript/React code (not minified)
- ✅ Fast refresh - React components update without losing state
- ✅ Better error messages - See actual file names and line numbers

**Note:** In development mode, the Vite dev server proxies API requests (`/api/*`) and WebSocket connections (`/ws`) to the Go backend running on port 28888.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system adopts a modular design with core components including:

- **Exchange Layer**: Unified exchange interface abstraction, shielding underlying API differences.
- **Price Monitor**: Global unique WebSocket price source, ensuring decision consistency.
- **Super Position Manager**: Core position manager, managing order lifecycle based on Slot mechanism.
- **Safety & Risk Control**: Multi-layer risk control, including startup checks, runtime monitoring, and anomaly circuit breaking.
